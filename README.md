This folder includes videos of the playthroughs of environments shown in the figures of the paper: 
On the Importance of Environments in Human-Robot Coordination. Matthew Fontaine*, Ya-Chuan Hsu*, Yulun Zhang*, Bryon Tjanaka, Stefanos Nikolaidis. RSS 2021. 


For the videos of Fig.7, we include both the playthrough of an mdp agent (1-mdp, 2-mdp) and a qmdp agent (1-qmdp,2-qmdp) for each environment. The robot is the green agent and the simulated human the blue agent.
